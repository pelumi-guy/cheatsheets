# Copying your Public SSH Key to a Server with Microsoft ssh client
type ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

# Get back your Linux server public IP address
ip addr show eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'

# Get your Linux server public IP address as seen from another location on the internet:
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -4 icanhazip.com

# Web stack debugging
Test and verify your assumptions
The idea is to ask a set of questions until you find the issue. For example, if you installed a web server and it isnâ€™t serving a page when browsing the IP, here are some questions you can ask yourself to start debugging:

- Is the web server started? - You can check using the service manager, also double check by checking process list.
- On what port should it listen? - Check your web server configuration
- Is it actually listening on this port? - ```netstat -lpdn``` - run as ```root``` or ```sudo``` so that you can see the process for each listening port
- It is listening on the correct server IP? - ```netstat``` is also your friend here
- Is there a firewall enabled?
- Have you looked at logs? - usually in ```/var/log``` and ```tail -f``` is your friend
- Can I connect to the HTTP port from the location I am browsing from? - ```curl``` is your friend
There is a good chance that at this point you will already have found part of the issue.

sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# allow ssh connections [!important]
sudo ufw allow ssh
* or If you configured your SSH daemon to use a different port, you will have to specify the appropriate port like:
sudo ufw allow 2222

# Enable ufw
sudo ufw enable

# Stop datadog monitoring agent
sudo systemctl stop datadog-agent
